About page
==========================


**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (Javascript). 

**Markdown** is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML). The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. 

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a stylesheets language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, paper, in speech, or in other media. 

**Sass** is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects. 

**Pico** is a Content Management System, or CMS. There is no administration backend or database to deal with. It simply doesn’t require write access on your server to function You simply create markdown files in the content folder and those files become your pages. This makes it more secure by design and reduces difficult PHP configuration. Since Pico doesn’t use a database for its backend, it has very low system requirements and will run on almost any web space.
